\subsection{Dilithium}

Dilithium is a module-LWE based signature scheme based on Fiat-Shamir with aborts.  The base ring is given 
by $R_{q,n} = \Z_q[x]/(x^n+1)$ with $q = 2^{23} - 2^{13} - 1 = 8380417$.

The public key consists of the high bits (13 lower order bits are dropped) of MLWE-samples
\[ \bt :=  \bA \bs_1 + \bs_2 \]
where $\bA$ is a $k \times \ell$  matrix over $R_{q,n}$ derived from a seed $\rho$ 
and $\bs_1, \bs_2$ vectors of length $\ell$ and $k$ make up the secret key and 
contain elements in $R_{q,n}$ with small coefficients of max size $\eta$.
A public key then contains the following data $pk = (\rho, \bt_1)$ where $\bt_1$
is obtained from $\bt$ by dropping the lowest $13$ bits.
A summary of the relevant (for verification) parameters is given in Table~\ref{tab:dilithium}.

\begin{table}\caption{Dilithium parameters used in verification}\label{tab:dilithium}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
\hline
Security level & 2 & 3 & 5 \\
\hline
$(k,\ell)$ & (4,4) & (6,5) & (8,7) \\
$\eta$ & 2 & 4 & 2 \\
$\beta$ & $78$ & $196$ & $120$ \\
$\gamma_1$ & $2^{17}$ & $2^{19}$ & $2^{19}$ \\ 
$\gamma_2$ & $(q-1)/88$ & $(q-1)/32$ & $(q-1)/32$ \\
$\omega$ & $80$ & $55$ & $75$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

A signature $\sigma = (\tilde{c}, \bz, \bh)$ consists of 3 components:
\bit
\item $\tilde{c}$: a challenge of $256$ bits obtained as the hash of the public key, message and $\bA \by$ where $\by$
is a vector with elements in $R_{q,n}$ with coefficients smaller than $\gamma_1$. 
\item $\bz$: a vector of length $\ell$ of polynomials with small coefficients, in particular, smaller than $\gamma_1 - \beta$.
\item $\bh$: a vector of length $k$ consisting of $k$ hint polynomials (essentially the overflows of a particular sum) whose
coefficients are ${0,1}$ and the max number of $1$'s in $\bh$ is $\omega$.
\eit

The signature verification then proceeds as follows, where $H$ is SHAKE-256 and the specification
of the other subroutines can be found in the original specification~\cite{dilithium}.
\begin{algorithm}[!ht] \label{algo:dilithium_verify}
\begin{scriptsize}
\caption{\emph{Dilithium verification}}
\KwIn{public key $pk = (\rho, \bt_1)$, message $M$, signature $\sigma = (\tilde{c}, \bz, \bh)$}
\KwOut{boolean indicating if signature is valid}
\Begin{
\everypar={\nl}
$\bA \in R_{q,n}^{k \times \ell}$ := ExpandA($\rho$)
 
$\mu \in \{0,1\}^{512} := H(H(\rho || \bt_1) || M)$

$c := SampleInBall(\tilde{c})$

$\bw_1' := UseHint_q(h, \bA \bz - 2^d \cdot c \bt_1, 2 \gamma_2)$

return $||\bz||_{\infty} < \gamma_1 - \beta$ and $\tilde{c} = H(\mu || \bw_1')$ and $\# 1's$ in $\bh$ is $\leq \omega$
}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{algorithm} 

The matrix $\bA \in R_{q,n}^{k \times \ell}$ is generated from $\rho$ but directly into the NTT domain.
In particular, every element $a_{i,j} \in R_q$ is represented in a very specific format, which is the following:
\bit
\item Let $r = 1753$ which is a $512$-th root of unity modulo $q$
\item A polynomial $a(x) \in R_q$ in NTT representation then is given by the array:
\[ [a(r_0), a(-r_0), a(r_1), a(-r_1), \ldots, a(r_{127}), a(-r_{127})] \]
\eit
where by definition $r_i = r^{brv(128 + i)}$ where $brv(k)$ denotes the 8-bit bitreversal of the number $k$.
Note that this is the same result as the bit-reversed version of the normal array
\[  [a(r), a(r^3), \ldots, a(r^{N-1})] \, .  \]


This is done to speed up step 4 in the verification procedure above, which can be computed as 
\[ NTT^{-1} (  \bA \cdot NTT(\bz)  - NTT(c) \cdot NTT(\bt_1 \cdot 2^d))  \]
which requires~(*):
\bit
\item $\ell + k + 1$ NTTs
\item $k$ inverse NTTs
\item $k (\ell + 1)$ pointwise multiplications of arrays of 256 elements in $\F_q$
\eit

\subsubsection*{Integrating Dilithium in Miden} 
Due to the formatting of $\bA$, i.e.\ it is derived from $\rho$ but directly into the NTT domain (with given ordering)
as defined in Dilithium, it is impossible to directly use this $\bA$ with the native Miden NTT routine.

If compatibility is required, then the only option is to first represent $\bA$ in the Miden NTT domain, by first
mapping $\bA$ to the time domain and then mapping it to the Miden NTT domain.  The result $\tilde{\bA}$
is fully equivalent with $\bA$, just represented in a different NTT domain.  This transformation however is
costly, in that it requires $k \times \ell$ calls to the original inverse NTT routine and also $k \times \ell$
calls to the Miden NTT routine.  Of course, it is possible to consider $\tilde{\bA}$ as part of the public key 
directly in Miden, but it is then impossible to directly derive it from $\rho$ (without going through the
different NTTs).

It compatibility is not required, i.e.\ it is allowed to derive a different public key from $\rho$, it looks 
tempting to derive $\tilde{\bA}$ directly in the Miden NTT domain from $\rho$.  However, this is not possible
since the corresponding polynomials in the time domain should have coefficients uniform modulo the 
Dilithium modulus and in particular, they should be small, since otherwise we cannot execute the Dilithium
operations by using the Miden arithmetic.  As such, the only option here seems to be to use the 
same $ExpandA$ routine as in Dilithium, but to consider the result to be defined in the time domain
and then use $k \times \ell$ Miden NTTs to map it to the frequency domain.  This approach 
will add another $k \times \ell$ Miden NTTs on top of (*) which  makes it the dominating cost.

\subsection{Falcon}

Falcon~\cite{falcon} is a lattice-based signature scheme using NTRU lattices and a hash-and-sign approach following GPV~\cite{GPV}.
Falcon works in a cyclotomic ring $R_{q,n} =  \Z_q[x]/(x^n+1)$ with $n = 2^k$, and an NTRU public key consists 
of a polynomial $h \in R_{q,n}$ which is computed as $g \cdot f^{-1}$ in $R_{q,n}$ where $f,g \in R_{q,n}$ that have small coefficients.
Recovering $f, g$ from $h$ corresponds to the NTRU-problem.  

Falcon specifies two parameter sets $n = 512$ and $n = 1024$ corresponding to NIST security levels I and V.  The modulus 
$q = 12289 = 12 \cdot 1024 + 1$ is prime and fixed for both sets.  The coefficients of the polynomials $f,g$ are sampled
from a discrete Gaussian with standardard deviation $\sigma_{f,g} = 1.17 \sqrt{q/2n}$.

The signature of a message $m$ consists of a salt $r$ and a pair of small polynomials $(s_1, s_2)$ such that 
$s_1 + s_2 h = H(r || m)$.  Furthermore, $s_1$ can be derived fully from $m , r$ and $s_2$ so the signature
is simply given by $(r, s_2)$.  The signature $(s_1,s_2)$ must satisfy $||(s_1,s_2)||^2 \leq \lfloor \beta^2 \rfloor$ where
$\beta = 1.1 \sigma \sqrt{2n}$.  In particular, $\beta^2 = 34034726$ for Level-I parameters and $\beta^2 = 70265242$
for Level-V parameters.  To verify a Falcon signature, one proceeds as described in Algorithm~\ref{algo:falcon_verify}

\begin{algorithm}[!ht] \label{algo:falcon_verify}
\begin{scriptsize}
\caption{\emph{Falcon verification}}
\KwIn{Message $m$, signature $sig = (r,s)$, publick key $pk = h$ and bound $\lfloor \beta^2 \rfloor$}
\KwOut{boolean indicating if signature is valid}
\Begin{
\everypar={\nl}
$c := HashToPoint(r||m,q,n)$ 

$s_2 = Decompress(s, 8 \cdot sbytelen - 328)$

if $(s_2 = \perp)$ then return false

$s_1 = c - s_2 h \bmod q$

if $||(s_1,s_2)||^2 \leq  \lfloor \beta^2 \rfloor$ then return true else return false
}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{algorithm} 

\subsubsection*{Integrating Falcon in Miden} Compared to Dilithium, Falcon is much easier to integrate into Miden due
to the fact that the main operation in Algorithm~\ref{algo:falcon_verify} is step 4 which mainly consists of the multiplication 
$s_2 h$.  Since both polynomials are given in the time domain, it is easy to compute their product by using the Miden 
NTT and inverse NTT routines as described in Section~\ref{section:multiplication-using-ntt} at a cost 
of two NTTs and 1 inverse NTT plus $n$ centered reductions modulo the Miden prime and $n$ reductions
modulo the Falcon prime.
